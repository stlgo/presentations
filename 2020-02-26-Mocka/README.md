## Presentation
In this session Chris Marfia will be introducing a new mocking and stubbing package named [Mocka](https://github.com/MonsantoCo/mocka). This package was authored and open-sourced by Chris at Bayer late last year. Chris will be walking through how Mocka came to be, how to use it, what features it has, and how it works internally. Please join Chris and see how you can leverage this new package to start mocking and stubbing in Go.

## Presenter
