## Presentation
Let's explore Go as a foundational language for security tools and walk through some typical examples. The content will be inspired by the recent book "Black Hat Go" from No Starch Press (https://nostarch.com/blackhatgo).

We'll cover the following topics:
- Why Go is a good fit for writing security tools
- Why other languages may be better for writing security tools
- Overview of the Penetration Testing Execution Standard
- Developing a DNS enumeration tool
- Developing a TCP scanning tool

## Presenter
Michael is a DevOps Engineer at Elastic. During the day, he writes a lot of Jenkins pipelines, debugs Makefiles, migrates the Beats build system to Mage, and ensures software releases continue to ship. By night, he studies Cyber Security topics and sharpens his Go skills.
