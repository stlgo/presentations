## Presentation
Go can be a hyper-productive language to develop in, but like most languages, has it's bad and good parts. Just like what JavaScript: The Good Parts did for JavaScript and Effective Java did for Java, there are nuances/gotchas to navigate in Go. This session walks through a number of ways you can do it wrong with appropriate solutions.

This session will walk through:
* Go best practices
* Go common mistakes
* Making your life easier with golangci-lint linting
