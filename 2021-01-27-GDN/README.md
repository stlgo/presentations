## Presentation
We are extremely excited to announce our first GDN Event - a Learning Go - Tips for all Gopher Levels, following the outpouring of desire for guidance on learning resources and tips we heard from the community during GopherCon 2020.

Learn how your fellow Gophers learnt Go, are continuing to learn, as well as getting some recommended learning resources.

The event will be hosted by Angelica Hill, and Wilken Rivera. It will feature a range of wonderful speakers from across the community, and across the world, speaking about what theyâ€™ve found helpful learning, resources they recommend, as well as tips & tricks to when learning Go.

All the chatter during the event will be in the #learngomeetup Slack channel in Gophers slack.
