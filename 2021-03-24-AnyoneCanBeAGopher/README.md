## Presentation
Anyone, even a British liberal arts major who once aspired to be an actress and then a journalist, can become a Gopher. This talk outlines my motivation, and struggles, to master coding and achieve Go competency during my first year working at The New York Times – with the help of several Go Gurus.

Please join us for this "reboot" of Angelica's GopherCon talk, allowing for followup discussion about her development "origin story." Of course, this event will be virtual!

## Presenter
Angelica is in Product Management at The New York Times in New York City, overseeing the backend platform infrastructure of NYT newsletters, emails, and push notifications. She has a Masters from the Journalism School at Columbia University, as well as a BA in Drama and English from Queen Mary’s University, London. Before that, Angelica graduated from the Acting Foundation Course of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. When not working in Go, organizing GDN (Google Developer Events) or other events in the Go community, Angelica encourages others to dive into software engineering - no matter their background, or where they are in their professional journey. She is a fierce advocate of diversity at work.
