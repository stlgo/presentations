## Presentation
Ever look at production behavior and think, what is going on??

Observability is when your app tells you what is happening. What is broken, what is different, what is slow, and what is normal. There are many degrees of observability, and the modern standard is distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry. It's open-source, with a governing body inside the CNCF, with single protocol plus implementations in all your languages. Plus automatic tracing in all your usual frameworks and clients. Give your applications a fast line of communication to you, for free! Or at least, vendor-neutral so you don't get locked in.

Jess will explain the what & why of OpenTelemetry, and demonstrate some distributed tracing magic in [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) (open source) and [Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/) (the best*).
