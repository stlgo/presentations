## Presentation
Adding observability to Golang applications in a microservices environment is a challenge. This talk will introduce [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), the [otel-go project](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go), and how to add instrumentation to your Golang application in a Kubernetes or Cloud Native world. In short: How I stopped worrying and learned to love microservices in Golang ;)

## Presenter
Vinod Vydier is an Observability Specialist in Cloud Native and container/Kubernetes environments. He also works as an OpenTelemetry contributor/approver and worked at [Observe](https://www.observeinc.com/) and [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) before [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/).
