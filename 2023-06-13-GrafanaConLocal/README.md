## Presentation
Join members of your local Grafana community for a two-hour meetup featuring a presentation on Grafana 10 followed by Q&A with your local Grafana experts. Youâ€™ll have time to chat with fellow developers, get to know the Grafanistas in your area, and most importantly: collect stickers.

## Presenter
Paul is a CNCF Ambassador and Developer Advocate at Grafana Labs. In this role, he encourages developers and testers alike to "shift left," bringing reliability testing earlier in the software development process. He's been a software engineer/architect for over 25 years, programming in various languages and platforms. Working with the open source community around cloud technologies like k6, Kubernetes, and Kafka, among others, keeps him young, as do his interests in punk rock music and playing bass guitar.

You may have seen some of his previous talks on YouTube hosting the k6 Office Hours or his channel for the St. Louis developer communities around Go, Kubernetes, and Cloud Native technologies.

## Event
The basic agenda follows:
* 5:30 - 6:00 Arrivals and food and drink
* 6:00 - 6:30 Presentation and Q&A
* 6:30 - 7:00 Wrap up and departures

## Sponsors

## Bloopers
* Paul used his laptop camera instead of the correct camera.
* The demo presentation did not get shared into the livestream; you'll have to use your imagination as you listen.
