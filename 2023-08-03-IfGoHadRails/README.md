## Presentation
Gophers know that Go is the "go-to" language (pun intended!) for creating command-line interfaces and performant backend services with robust APIs. Unlike Ruby on Rails, building front-end web applications is not the typical use case for Go. But what if Go had Rails?

Enter [Pushup](https://pushup.adhoc.dev/), an MIT-licensed web framework focused on the front-end experience of writing templates and having an opinionated project layout translating to URL routes. As Rails did for Ruby and Django for Python, Pushup aims for Go by making it faster to develop and easier to maintain server-side web applications.

Join us as [Paul Balogh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pabalogh/) leads the discussion and a demonstration of this early-stage project from the folks who saved America during the Healthcare.gov debacle.
