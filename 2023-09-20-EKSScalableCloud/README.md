Kubernetes provides workload portability but what about your clusters? How much of the infrastructure can be reused in different environments? Weâ€™ll show examples for what it takes to build an on-prem Kubernetes environment and then build a production environment in AWS.

## Presenter
[Justin Garrison](https://justingarrison.com/) is a developer advocate at AWS where he helps improve cloud services for everyone. He has made Oscar winning movies and built infrastructure for popular streaming services. In his spare time he tinkers with hardware and streams Moana on repeat.

## Bloopers
* Disaster averted thanks to [OCI](https://objectcomputing.com/) having extra meeting space; we double-booked ourselves when a [Kafka meetup](https://www.meetup.com/saint-louis-kafka-meetup-group/events/295507590/) was already scheduled there.
* Paul's meeting kickoff and presentation were muted.
* Justin's audio dropped during Q&A.
