## Presentation
Security teams spend up to a quarter of their day prioritizing alerts, only to find that more than a third are false positives. Teams are overwhelmed as they struggle to keep up with the incessant stream of notifications vying for their attention. The siloed nature of security and DevOps teams often leaves the folks managing the stack in the dark. We’ll examine why sharing knowledge is important and how open source allows teams to adopt those processes quickly.

## Presenter
John is the Head of Dev Rel at Paladin Cloud, an open source cloud security project. He also hosts a monthly AI Security Podcast, Cyber Sentries, which explores artificial intelligence’s transformative potential on cloud security. Outside of work, John enjoys playing board games with friends and reading with a cat curled in his lap.
