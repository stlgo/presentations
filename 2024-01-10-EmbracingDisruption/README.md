## Presentation
Failure happens! It's our job to turn these disruptions into learning opportunities. As our software has become more distributed and complex, the "shift-left" movement brings reliability testing to earlier stages of development. Ensuring reliability goes beyond simple end-to-end tests.

To ensure the highest levels of reliability, you must perform a suite of testing types. Incorporate contract tests to validate APIs; load tests for scaling predictability. Let's learn from Chaos Engineering principles by incorporating disruptive behavior into your system _before_ production. 

Join Paul as we learn ways to incorporate a plethora of testing into your software development pipeline. We'll discuss the pros and cons of each and what you can do to add these to your processes. 

By embracing a little disruption, you can significantly improve the reliability of your system.

## Presenter
Paul is a CNCF Ambassador, GoBridge Ambassador, and a Developer Advocate at Grafana Labs. In this role, he encourages developers and testers alike to "shift left," bringing reliability testing earlier in the software development process.
