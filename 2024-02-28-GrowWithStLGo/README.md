## Presentation
Are you just getting started with Go development or just wondering what all the fuss is about? Well, if so, this session is for you!

## Presenter
Andy Schiefelbein is currently working in cyber security at a telecommunications company. He has had a 26 year career in technology, has a Masters in Computer Science, and 7 software patents to his name.
