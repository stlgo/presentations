## Presentation
Join us to learn how you can create secure applications using Go. 

This session will be the second in our "Grow with STL Go" series of workshops for beginners. You'll learn where and when to use cryptography to secure data on disk and in transit while minimizing unintentional data leaks.

If you are just getting started with Go development, this is an ideal session for you!

## Presenter
