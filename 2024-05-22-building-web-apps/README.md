## Presentation
Join us for an insightful session as Paul shares his recent journey of migrating a CGI-based Perl web application to Go. _Yes, you heard it right!_ It's been an exciting adventure filled with discoveries and challenges, and we're eager to walk through the entire process.

Paul's perspective as a traditional back-end developer, well-versed in crafting RESTful APIs but not necessarily fluent in Javascript and CSS frontends, offers a unique angle to this discussion.

Whether you're a newcomer to Go or aspiring to delve into web application development using _our favorite language_, this session promises to be both enlightening and practical. Don't miss out on learning and taking your Go development skills to the next level!

Highlighted projects include:
* [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) - Live reloading
* [Templ](https://templ.guide) - HTML templating
* [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) - Dynamic page updating with minimal JS

## Presenter
Paul is a CNCF Ambassador, GoBridge Ambassador, Software Architect, and Developer Advocate. In his many roles, he has encouraged developers and testers alike to "shift left," bringing reliability testing earlier in the software development process.

## Event
The basic agenda follows:
* 5:30 - 6:00 Food and networking (Go excels at networking).
* 6:00 - 6:10 **LIVESTREAM** begins with announcements, intros, etc.
* 6:15 - 7:00 Main presentation of the month.
