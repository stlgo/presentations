## Presentation

Virtual web hosting allows you to run your own websites. Using Golang alone, you can create your own web server without the need for additional software like Apache HTTPD or Nginx.

Host your own static HTML and Javascript website, or a fully active backend webservice! You will even get tips and tricks on how to do this in a scaled application.

Here are a few points we'll be covering with this informative session:
- Apache HTTPD and Nginx
- CGI with Perl, Python, and PHP
- Webservices with SOAP and REST
- Dealing with high volumes and load balancing

This talk will culminate with a code walk-through and demonstration of hosting your own sites using native Go functionality.

## Presenter
Andy Schiefelbein is currently working in cyber security at a telecommunications company. He has had a 26 year career in technology, has a Masters in Computer Science, and 7 software patents to his name.

When not toiling away the hours in the underground digital salt mines you can often find him playing bass trombone in various organizations around town or volunteering with the Missouri Master Gardners.
