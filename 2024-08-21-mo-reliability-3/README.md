## Presentation #1
_Developer Psychology_ by Larry F.

Let's take an entertaining look at the various personality types you engage within the tech industry. We'll also discuss traits benefiting certain roles over others as well as learn how diversity creates stronger teams.

## Presentation #2
_Flow Model Pattern_ by Péter Földházi

Most Test Automation Engineers may be familiar with the Page Object Pattern, which allows engineers to model the application for their test solutions.

The Flow Model Pattern enhances the Page Object by introducing an additional facade for the logic of the application, making it easier to maintain the typical user steps and user flows that testers run. Additionally, this concept can be leveraged not only in UI but in API testing as well.

Since 2024, the Flow Model Pattern is part of the official ISTQB Test Automation Engineering curriculum.

Péter invites all of you to learn about this design pattern and see how you can implement it in your current project.
